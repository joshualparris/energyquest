# energyquest
A game where the main character collects energy and turns it into other things.
# Energy Quest

Energy Quest is an early prototype built with Unity. The aim is to create a small third‑person game where the player collects energy items in a forest environment. The project currently uses Unity's starter assets and a simple "Playground" scene for experimentation. Gameplay elements such as scoring and menus have not yet been implemented.

## Unity version

This project was created with **Unity 2021.3.20f1** as recorded in `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`.

```
m_EditorVersion: 2021.3.20f1
```

## Opening the project

1. Launch **Unity Hub**.
2. Click **Add** and select this repository's folder.
3. Ensure the Unity version is set to **2021.3.20f1** (or a compatible 2021 LTS version).
4. Open the project from Unity Hub.

## Running the sample scene

1. In the Unity editor, open `Assets/Scenes/Playground.unity`.
2. Press the **Play** button at the top of the editor to run the scene.
3. Use the third‑person controller to move around the sample environment.

## Project status

The repository contains placeholder art, scripts from Unity's starter assets and a basic environment. It is a foundation for future development and does not yet include objectives beyond simple movement in the scene.
